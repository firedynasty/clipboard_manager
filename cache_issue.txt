Cache Issue - Vercel Blob CDN Stale Reads
==========================================

Problem:
- Save and Append buttons appeared to work (content showed in UI) but didn't persist across tabs/refreshes
- Content would only appear after multiple refreshes

Root Causes:

1. Silent error swallowing in saveContent()
   - The saveContent function caught API errors silently, so failed saves looked successful in the UI
   - setSavedContent() updated React state before the API call, making it appear saved
   - Fix: Let errors propagate so the caller can alert the user. Added a { silent } option for auto-save.

2. Vercel Blob CDN caching
   - The GET endpoint fetched blob content via fetch(blob.url), which hits the Vercel Blob CDN
   - The CDN caches aggressively, so after writing new content, reads still returned stale data
   - Fix: Added cache-busting query param (blob.url + '?t=' + Date.now()) to bypass CDN cache
   - Also added Cache-Control: no-store header on GET responses to prevent browser caching

Files Changed:
- src/App.js - saveContent now throws on API failure instead of silently catching
- api/files.js - Cache-busting on blob URL fetch + no-store response header
